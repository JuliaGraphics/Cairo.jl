## Bindings to the Cairo graphics library ##

Adaptation to [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/), a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices. 

Some of the functions implemented by this wrapper may be documented in [Graphics.jl](https://juliagraphics.github.io/Graphics.jl/stable/).

There is an extensive set of [examples](samples/Samples.md).
